Step 1 Create a database.
Run the following command to create a database:
mysql> CREATE DATABASE Vegetables;
After the creation is complete, view information about the created database.
mysql> SHOW databases;

Use the USE statement to access the database, and then use the SELECT statement to
view information about the database.
mysql> USE Vegetables;
mysql> SELECT database();


Step 2 Create a data table.
When creating a table, set ID to the primary key and set Name and PIC to NOT NULL.
mysql> CREATE TABLE Vegetables ( ID SMALLINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY , Name VARCHAR(10)
NOT NULL , Price DECIMAL(5, 2) , Qty DECIMAL(7, 2) , PIC VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL );
To make the statement structure clearer, you can also write it as follows:
mysql> CREATE TABLE Vegetables (
 -> ID SMALLINT UNSIGNED PRIMARY KEY,
 -> Name VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
 -> Price DECIMAL(5, 2),
 -> Qty DECIMAL(7, 2),
 -> PIC VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL
-> );

After the table is created, use related statements to view information about the table,
such as SHOW and SELECT.


show tables;

view the table structure 
DESC Vegetables;   ## vegetables is name of table


Step 3 Add data.
Add data to the table in sequence.
mysql> INSERT Vegetables VALUES
 -> (1,'Cabbage',NULL,200,'Tom'),
 -> (2,'Potato',2.60,300,'Peter'),
 -> (3,'Bok choy',6,150,'Jim'),
 -> (4,'Tomato',5.2,230,'Betty'),
-> (5,'Cucumber',8,330,'Jim');


Step 4 Perform data queries.
Query information about the vegetables managed by Jim from the table.
mysql> SELECT * FROM Vegetables WHERE PIC='Jim';

mysql> SELECT * FROM Vegetables WHERE Price>7 and Qty<180;

Step 5 Modify data.
Change the price of the vegetable whose ID is 1 to 4.2.
mysql> UPDATE Vegetables SET Price=4.2 WHERE ID=1;


Step 6 Create users and grant permissions.
Create users vegetable_user and vegetable_admin as planned and set their passwords
to Huawei@123.
mysql> CREATE USER vegetable_user@localhost identified by 'Huawei@123';

Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.50 sec)
mysql> CREATE USER vegetable_admin@localhost identified by 'Huawei@123';
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.41 sec)

Modify the attributes of the users.
mysql> use mysql;
mysql> UPDATE user SET HOST='%' WHERE user LIKE 'vege%';



Grant permissions to the created users as planned.
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql> flush privileges;
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON Vegetables.* TO vegetable_admin@'%';
mysql> GRANT SELECT ON Vegetables.* TO vegetable_user@'%';




Step 7 Modify and delete the database, data tables, and users.
Change the table name from Vegetables to Vegetable1.
mysql> ALTER TABLE Vegetables rename as Vegetable1;

Delete the Vegetable1 table.
mysql> DROP TABLE Vegetable1;

Delete the Vegetables database.
mysql> DROP DATABASE Vegetables;


Log in to the MySQL database as user root and delete users vegetable_user and
vegetable_admin.
mysql> DROP USER vegetable_user, vegetable_admin;
